**************************************************************************

In July 2022 I have adapted mod_sqlite to sqlite3 and published on GitHub.

First tests have been run on Alma Linux 8.6 with Apache 2.4.37.

SQLite database has been created in /tmp after disabling PrivateTmp=True in /usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service.
If SQLite database is created in /var and SE Linux is enabled Apache may not be able to access database.
